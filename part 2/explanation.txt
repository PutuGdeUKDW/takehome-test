I have created a run.sh script that deploys both SonarQube and Postgres Docker containers, assuming Docker and Docker Compose are already installed on the machine. The configuration should meet the requirements as outlined.

Regarding SonarQube, I recently learned how to deploy it, and during this process, I discovered that recent versions of SonarQube already come with a built-in Golang plugin. This was confirmed by the following error message:
sonarqube    | Caused by: org.sonar.api.utils.MessageException: Found a plugin 'SonarGo' in the directory 'extensions/plugins' with the same key [go] as a built-in feature 'Go Code Quality and Security'. Please remove 'extensions/plugins/sonar-golang-plugin-1.2.11.jar'.

From this, I concluded that the built-in Golang plugin should automatically fulfill Test Case 1, Requirement 4, meaning SonarQube already includes the necessary support for Golang.

As for the .env file, while best practices suggest storing sensitive information in a secure location such as an S3 bucket, for the sake of this assignment, I have uploaded it to the repository for convenience. I would never do this in a live scenario.
